# Genomic Statistical Analysis Tool in R

## Description
This R-based tool is designed to conduct comprehensive statistical analyses on genetic data. It calculates genotype probabilities, allele distributions, and integrates statistical tests to assess differences in allele frequencies. The tool provides both descriptive and inferential statistical outputs, supported by visual data representations.

## Features
- **Probability Mass Functions (PMFs):** Calculation and visualization of genotype combination probabilities.
- **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs):** Aggregation of probabilities to provide insights into allele count distributions.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and skewness for allele counts.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Two-sample t-tests to compare mean differences between allele counts.
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Models to assess the impact of genotypes and other factors like ancestry and income on genetic risk.
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, point plots, step functions, and scatter plots with regression lines.

## Installation
To run this analysis tool, ensure that you have R installed along with the required packages. You can install the necessary packages using the following commands in R:
```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Djinho/Genomic-Statistical-Analysis-in-R-.git
Usage
To execute the analysis, open the R script in your R environment (e.g., RStudio) and run the script. Ensure your input data is formatted correctly as per the examples provided in the data_samples folder.

Data Format
The tool expects input data in CSV format with specific columns depending on the analysis. Refer to the data_samples directory for sample CSV files.
